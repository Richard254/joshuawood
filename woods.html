									<p>There’s an undeniable dream that’s alive today, fervently burning in the hearts and minds of people all across this planet. And as much as the media will downplay much of the world’s biggest success stories in place of disheartening coverage of calamity and strife, there are some truly inspiring entrepreneurs out there who offer up a plate of motivational and heart-warming success that keeps the flame of hope alive.</p>

<p>If you’re an networker like me, you’ve likely faced some challenges in your life.We often struggle to keep the proverbial lights on. There’s an enormous set of demands weighing on our shoulders. In order to grow into a successful enterprise, you have to wear many hats, especially in the beginning. Plus, you have to be wary of the bottom line and not overspend. There’s a huge risk-to-reward ratio that you’re always balancing.</p>

<p>That’s why I feel that some of these success stories are truly motivating. These are inspiring networkers who’ve been in the trenches architecting, building and crafting their businesses through blood and sweat equity. Do you need to know it all in business? No. Of course not. But having a solid basis of an understanding of the macroeconomic forces at play and how to best position your offers, optimize conversions and scale over time is crucial.</p>

<p>Networkers are leaders and know how to lead, leading by example. But most importantly, what sets them apart is their true inner desire to add an enormous amount of value. And in business, that’s truly what it takes at the end of the day. If you’re not going out of your way to add an enormous amount of value, you’re largely wasting your time.</p>

									<h2>How To Participate In The Networking Renaissance</h2>
									<p>We are in a renaissance period for networking. It is only in the past few years that billions of people have connected to each other via global networks (ie - Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, & Google) and started to publicly share in trillions of ways.</p>
									<p>It is the field of networking that is perhaps best poised to understand this massive data. On the other hand, it is us as entrepreneurs who may be best poised to understand how the discoveries of networking apply to our day-to-day lives.

What we now know is that the simple act of constantly putting yourself in an open network, a network where people aren’t connected to each other, will give you a huge advantage in your career. It will give you a vision advantage that allows you creatively capitalize on new amazing opportunities. More importantly, it will expose you to the conditions you need in order to build the skill-set and mindset of a network broker.</p>

									<h2>Motivational factors</h2>
									<p>Growing up ‘uncomfortable’ gave me the freedom to create an identity that wasn’t based completely on belonging to one group. This made it easier for me to go against the grain and make two of the most important decisions in my career; joining superlife when no one else I knew was an networker and taking a risk to in building deeper connections with people i didnt quite know.

<p>Each of these decisions required tremendous leaps of faith that my unique upbringing ultimately made it easier to make.

Throughout my career, I’ve continued to surround myself in new groups.

Today, the organization I joined, helps connect the world’s top young networkers to new groups they normally wouldn’t connect with. We translate the objectives of each group in order to create platforms that help networkers give back.</p>
