												<h4>FIBERSOL-2</h4>
												<p>Fibersol-2 is a soluble fiber which helps the process of waste elimination and colon cleansing, as well as helps to maintain balanced bowels, support normal bowel regularity and fecal volume, and ensures healthy digestive function. It is a safe (GRAS) maltodextrin, easily mixed in water and carries no flavor. Fibersol-2 has a very low viscosity, high solubility, low hygroscopicity and clarity in solution. Because it is high in naturally occurring chemical bonds that remain undigested even in the digestive tract, it helps to support overall health by helping to maintain normal cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels. It also promotes immune health.
Fibersol-2 is an innovative, dynamic type of fiber. It is not absorbed into the blood stream, which means that it remains intact and ready for action in the lower portion of the digestive tract, the colon. Fibersol-2 has been found to increase fecal volume by 1.8 times and fecal frequency by 1.5 times. Fibersol-2 is also effective in promoting healthy cholesterol levels.</p>

												<h4>CHLOROPHYLL</h4>
												<p>Chlorophyll is plant’s blood. It is what gives life to plants, containing life-sustaining nutrients that are easily absorbed by the body. Chlorophyll has a molecular structure that is similar to hemoglobin present in our red blood cells. It builds up the blood just like iron.
Chlorophyll helps regulate the level of calcium in our blood. Research has shown that women lose 40% calcium when they menstruate, and chlorophyll helps in replenishing the calcium level. Chlorophyll is colon friendly because it inhibits the growth and development of unfriendly bacteria. Bacteria that promotes diseases find it difficult to thrive in the presence of chlorophyll because of its ability to counteract toxins.
As a cleansing agent, chlorophyll helps to clean the structure of the cell and its important mineral help build new cell life. Little wonder it has been given the name “liquid sunshine” and is a great cleanser and healer for chronic conditions both internally and externally. Also, chlorophyll promotes colon health by destroying disease-causing bacteria.</p>

												<h4>AMLA EXTRACT</h4>
												<p>Amla is a name used to describe the Indian Gooseberry. It is the fruit of the Amalaki plant. Its health benefits include improvement of body metabolism, and supply of vitamin C. Amla is excellent for your liver, bones and teeth. More so, it stimulates the production of red blood cells and promotes growth of tissues.
On to digestive health, the Amla extract contained in SCC15 helps relieve stomach and colon inflammation. Amla extract nourishes the tissues and gently flushes out natural toxins. Its cooling effect removes excess pitta from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting the development of a healthy lining in the stomach and proper digestive functions. It also cleanses the colon, eliminates excess heat and toxins, and supports healthy bowel movements.
With its potent antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, Amla extract helps to counteract the effect of microbes in your body. This is of great importance as new strains of bacteria will become more resistant to antibiotics. Research has shown that Amla extract is potent against cholera, staphylococcus, and pseudomonas bacteria.</p>

												<h4>GREEN APPLE EXTRACT</h4>
												<p>Why do we use green apples in SCC15? It is a well-known fact that all apples have health benefits. So, what makes green apples tick? Green apples are packed with vitamins, fiber, protein and minerals that helps enhance your colon health. Green apples are helpful in the fight against disorders of the digestive system, regulation of blood glucose levels, and the presence of good cholesterol among others. Green apple also has a high dietary fiber content which helps in regulating bowel movement thus enhancing the overall digestive process.
Green apple powder reduces the chances of developing colon cancer. Green apple powder has rich store of flavonoids and vitamin C. The group of flavonoids found most in green apples are epicatechin and cyandin. Together with vitamin C, they act as antioxidants and flush out free radicals which damages your cells.</p>

												<h4>BEETROOT POWDER</h4>
												<p>The beetroot powder has been gaining popularity recently as a functional food that promotes good health. Its benefits have been promoted by health magazine. Beetroot powder is derived from the beetroot vegetable. The beetroot vegetable is round in shape. Some varieties may be yellow or stripped. It belongs to the same family as the sugar beets, turnips, and rutabagas. Beetroots is rich in Vitamins A, B6 and C. It is also rich in folate, magnesium, potassium, iron, soluble fiber, and proteins. Beetroot is rich in anti-oxidants which helps eradicate free radicals in the body.
Beetroot serves as a natural detoxification agent. It aids the body to detoxify and body flush away heavy metals, toxins and waste from the blood. It is able to do this because of the compound glutathione, which is essential for detoxification within the colon, liver and other digestive organs.
As a plus, the fiber present in beetroot powder enhances regular bowel movements, while getting rid of the waste and toxins from the digestive tract. It is the betalains in beetroot that help to synthesize glutathione – enabling the body to neutralize toxins and make them water-soluble, and be flushed out of the body through the urine.
Also, beetroot helps in cleaning the liver, allowing it to function optimally. This is important because the liver is the main detoxification center of the body. It works extra hard to rid our blood of toxins, while producing bile which is needed for the emulsification of fat, breakdown of hormones, and storage of mineral, iron and vitamins.</p>

												<h4>ALOE VERA POWDER</h4>
												<p>The genus aloe consists of about 420 species. Aloe Vera is just one of these species. The Aloe Vera belongs to the Liliaceae family. It has about 75 active components including vitamins, minerals, saccharides, amino acids, anthraquinones, enzymes, lignin, saponins and salicylic acid. Of the 22 amino acids required for optimal functioning of the human body, the Aloe Vera provides 20. It also provides eight of the essential amino acids.
Aloe Vera is beneficial for the colon and the entire digestive system due to its laxative and anti-inflammatory components. The aloe vera powder present in SCC15 helps digestion, restores your body’s pH balance and inhibits the formation of yeast. It also encourages the formation of friendly bacteria and regulates bowel movement.
A study published in the Journal of Research indicates that 30 milliliters of Aloe Vera juice/powder twice daily significantly reduced the discomfort experienced by patients of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The number of participants involved in this study were 33. The participants also experienced a decrease in the level of flatulence, but stool consistence, frequency and urgency remained unchanged. This study has proven that Aloe Vera powder can have positive benefits on IBS patients.
The Aloe Vera powder present in SCC15 can also help improve the symptoms in people with exceedingly high gastric acid levels. A study published in the Avicenna Journal of Phytomedicine has proven this. In the study, Aloe Vera was tested on a group of rats with gastrointestinal problems. The levels of gastric acid reduced significantly in the rats treated with Aloe Vera. The study also measured the connection between the brain and the gut and reported data on the water content found in the brains of the rats treated with Aloe Vera. There was a reduced water content in the treated rats, suggesting that the brain influences the gut and gastrointestinal problems.
Our product is a result of intensive and adequate research because we desire to give you the best. Thus, aloe vera contributes significantly to the many benefits that SCC15 offers.</p>

												<h4>ASTAXANTHIN</h4>
												<p>Astaxanthin is a super-antioxidant present in several forms of marine life. It is a reddish colored pigment that is produced by microalgae. Astaxanthin is often referred to as the King of Carotenoids (apple___). It is a hundred times more potent than the well-known carotenoids such as beta-carotene and lycopene. What makes astaxanthin tick is that it does not become pro-oxidant in the body. Hence, it is one of the most potent and powerfully effective antioxidants you can ingest.
Astaxanthin has been shown to help treat inflammations in the body, especially in the intestines. It does this by helping the leaky gut to heal. A study has indicated that astaxanthin might even help prevent stomach ulcers. Another study conducted by Japanese researchers have found that natural astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant, can be a potent new candidate for a new approach for intestinal health. The study showed that natural astaxanthin improved the balance of intestinal bacteria by reducing the number of unfriendly bacteria and increasing the population of healthy bacteria in mice fed high fat diets.
Additionally, the astaxanthin present in SCC15 helps to support immune function, improves cardiovascular health, protects cells and nervous system from damage due to oxidative stress, and support brain health.</p>

												<h4>GRAPE SEED POWDER</h4>
												<p>The medical benefits of grapes have been enjoyed by the Europeans for over a thousand years. The powder is made by grinding the seeds of red wine grapes. Grape seed powder has strong anti-cancer properties. A study, carried out in 2013, and published in the American Association for Cancer Research has verified the anti-cancer properties (particularly colon cancer) of the grape seed powder. A group of mice with colon tumors were fed of grape seed extract for 18 weeks. At the end of the trial, significant reductions in the size of the tumors were observed. According to the scientists “these findings suggested that inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis are targeted by grape seed extract to prevent colorectal cancer.”</p>

												<h4>MILK THISTLE</h4>
												<p>Milk thistle is a natural herb with strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. It plays a very important role in body detoxification. Milk thistle enhances digestive function by supporting enzyme production, stimulating the production and release of bile, decreasing inflammation, and soothing all mucous membranes in the body. Milk thistle works by drawing dangerous toxins out of the body. These toxins can cause a range of symptoms and diseases in the body including diabetes, disorders of the gall bladder, negative effects of chemotherapy, skin damage and others.
Due to the strong antioxidant propeties, milk thistle fights free radicals and impedes the aging process. Also, milk thistle contains a high amount of lipophilic extracts which acts as bioflavonoid antioxidants, enhancing immune function and impeding oxidative stress.</p>
